# gRPC server with Asp Net Core

This is a sample application created with Asp Net Core gRPC. It can be used to understand the basic concept of the gRPC server and as a base application for creating gPRC services.

## Installing / Getting started

After cloning the repository, you should build the application first, it is kind of mandatory for gRPC applications that after every change in the proto file or in the service, the build should done to reflect those changes.


### Deploying / Publishing

I have deployed and tested this application with Azure app service & IIS, you only need to configure the web.config file before deploying.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* The application demonstrates gRPC server in working with Asp.Net Core.
* It hosts a service that allows the client application to Post 'Company' details.
* You can test the application either by gRPC Client application or any 3rd party application.
